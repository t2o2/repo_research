Task:

We would like to have a tool that can help us show the historical number of unique active developers within a group of
repos. The definition of an active developer is a developer who have committed a change to any of the repos within the 
rolling 30 days window throughout the commit history.

Write a software that can take a toml file like this:
--------
# Ecosystem Level Information
title = "Magi"

sub_ecosystems = []

github_organizations = ["https://github.com/magi-project"]

# Repositories
[[repo]]
url = "https://github.com/m-pays/m-cpuminer-qt"

[[repo]]
url = "https://github.com/m-pays/m-cpuminer-v2"

[[repo]]
url = "https://github.com/m-pays/magi"

[[repo]]
url = "https://github.com/m-pays/magi-api-cpp"
--------

And generate a csv file which looks like this:

date       | active developers
-----------+------------------
2021-01-10 | 10
2021-01-11 | 2
2021-01-12 | 23
2021-01-13 | 9
